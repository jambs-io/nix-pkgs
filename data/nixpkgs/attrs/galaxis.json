    "desc_long": "Lifeboats from a crippled interstellar liner are adrift in a starfield. To\nfind them, you can place probes that look in all eight compass directions\nand tell you how many lifeboats they see. If you drop a probe directly on\na lifeboat it will be revealed immediately. Your objective: find the\nlifeboats as quickly as possible, before the stranded passengers run out\nof oxygen!\n\nThis is a UNIX-hosted, curses-based clone of the nifty little Macintosh\nfreeware game Galaxis. It doesn't have the super-simple, point-and-click\ninterface of the original, but compensates by automating away some of the\ngame's simpler deductions.\n",
