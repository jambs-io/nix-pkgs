    "desc_long": "Movine is a simple database migration manager that aims to be compatible\nwith real-world migration work. Many migration managers get confused\nwith complicated development strategies for migrations. Oftentimes\nmigration managers do not warn you if the SQL saved in git differs from\nwhat was actually run on the database. Movine solves this issue by\nkeeping track of the unique hashes for the <literal>up.sql</literal> and\n<literal>down.sql</literal> for each migration, and provides tools for\nfixing issues. This allows users to easily keep track of whether their\nlocal migration history matches the one on the database.\n\nThis project is currently in early stages.\n\nMovine does not aim to be an ORM.\nConsider <link xling:href=\"https://diesel.rs/\">diesel</link> instead if\nyou want an ORM.\n",
