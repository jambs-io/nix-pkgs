There\nare no icons, no button bars, no icon docks, no root menus, no nothing: if\nyou want all that, then other programs can provide it. There's no\nconfigurability either: if you want that, you want a different window\nmanager; one that helps your operating system in its evil conquest of your\ndisc space and its annexation of your physical memory.\n",
