    "desc_long": "PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python.\nIn a nutshell, PLY is nothing more than a straightforward lex/yacc\nimplementation.  Here is a list of its essential features: It's\nimplemented entirely in Python; It uses LR-parsing which is\nreasonably efficient and well suited for larger grammars; PLY\nprovides most of the standard lex/yacc features including support for\nempty productions, precedence rules, error recovery, and support for\nambiguous grammars; PLY is straightforward to use and provides very\nextensive error checking; PLY doesn't try to do anything more or less\nthan provide the basic lex/yacc functionality.  In other words, it's\nnot a large parsing framework or a component of some larger system.\n",
