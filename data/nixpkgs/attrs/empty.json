This tool is definitely\nuseful in programming of shell scripts designed to communicate with\ninteractive programs like telnet, ssh, ftp, etc. In some cases empty can\nbe the simplest replacement for TCL/expect or other similar programming\ntools because empty:\n\n- can be easily invoked directly from shell prompt or script\n- does not use TCL, Perl, PHP, Python or anything else as an underlying language\n- is written entirely in C\n- has small and simple source code\n- can easily be ported to almost all UNIX-like systems\n",
