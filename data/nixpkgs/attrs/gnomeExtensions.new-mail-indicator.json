Click on the icon does toggle your email client window.*** Do not disable the notifications of your default email client! *** It is not a standalone mail checker, you need your email client to be running. *** Please check that the xdg-utils package is installed.\n\n Email clients verified at the moment are: Thunderbird, Evolution, Geary, Mailspring. Please ask to add the client, including special packaging (snap/flatpak), that you need. If you report an error, please provide at least the distribution and the email client you use through the GitHub link.\n\n For persistent notifications only, see: https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3951/persistent-email-notifications .",
