IPTraf-ng\ngathers data like TCP connection packet and byte counts, interface\nstatistics and activity indicators, TCP/UDP traffic breakdowns, and LAN\nstation packet and byte counts. IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic\nmonitor which shows TCP flag information, packet and byte counts, ICMP\ndetails, OSPF packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings; interface\nstatistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP and other IP packet counts,\nIP checksum errors, interface activity and packet size counts; a TCP and\nUDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and outgoing packets for\ncommon TCP and UDP application ports, a LAN statistics module that\ndiscovers active hosts and displays statistics about their activity; TCP,\nUDP and other protocol display filters so you can view just the traffic\nyou want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN, SLIP, PPP, and\nloopback interfaces; and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface\nof the Linux kernel, so it can be used on a wide variety of supported\nnetwork cards.\n",
