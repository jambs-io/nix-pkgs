Now the\nacronym follows after Text Editor and Corrector, or Text Editor\nCharacter-Oriented.\n\nTECO is a character-oriented text editor, originally developed by Dan\nMurphy at MIT circa 1962. It is also a Turing-complete imperative\ninterpreted programming language for text manipulation, done via\nuser-loaded sets of macros. In fact, the venerable Emacs was born as a set\nof Editor MACroS for TECO.\n\nTECOC is a portable C implementation of TECO-11.\n",
