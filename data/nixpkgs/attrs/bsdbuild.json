Derived from the\ntraditional 4.4BSD make libraries, BSDBuild allows BSD-style\nMakefiles (without BSD make extensions), and works natively\nunder most operating systems and make flavors. Since BSDBuild\nis implemented as a library (as opposed to a macro package),\nMakefiles are edited directly, as opposed to being compiled\n(however, if the build directory is separate from the source\ndirectory, BSDBuild will produce the required Makefiles in place).\n",
