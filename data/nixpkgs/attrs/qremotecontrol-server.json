By using the touch pad of your\nPhone you can for example open the internet browser and navigate to\nthe pages you want to visit, use the music player or your media center\nwithout being next to your PC or laptop. Summarizing QRemoteControl\nallows you to do almost everything you would be able to do with a\nmouse and a keyboard, but from a greater distance. To make these\nreplacements possible QRemoteControl offers you a touch pad, a\nkeyboard, multimedia keys and buttons for starting applications. Even\npowering on the computer via Wake On Lan is supported.\n",
