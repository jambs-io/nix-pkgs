    "desc_long": "Each section has an active/bypass switch, frequency, bandwidth and gain controls.\nThere is also a global bypass switch and gain control.\nThe 2nd order resonant filters are implemented using a Mitra-Regalia style lattice filter.\nAll switches and controls are internally smoothed, so they can be used 'live' whithout any clicks or zipper noises.\nThis should make this plugin a good candidate for use in systems that allow automation of plugin control ports, such as Ardour, or for stage use.\n",
