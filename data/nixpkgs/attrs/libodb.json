It provides\ntools, APIs, and library support that allow you to persist C++ objects\nto a relational database (RDBMS) without having to deal with tables,\ncolumns, or SQL and without manually writing any of the mapping code.\nFor more information see:\n\nhttp://www.codesynthesis.com/products/odb/\n\nThis package contains the common ODB runtime library. Every application\nthat includes code generated by the ODB compiler will need to link to\nthis library.\n",
