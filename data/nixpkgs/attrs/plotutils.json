Its centerpiece is libplot, a powerful C/C++\n        function library for exporting 2-D vector graphics in many file\n        formats, both vector and raster.  It can also do vector graphics\n        animations.\n\n        libplot is device-independent in the sense that its API (application\n        programming interface) does not depend on the type of graphics file\n        to be exported.\n\n        Besides libplot, the package contains command-line programs for\n        plotting scientific data.  Many of them use libplot to export\n        graphics.\n",
