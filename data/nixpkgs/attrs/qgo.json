It supports playing online at\nIGS-compatible servers (including some special tweaks for WING and LGS,\nalso NNGS was reported to work) and locally against gnugo (or other\nGTP-compliant engines). It also has rudimentary support for editing SGF\nfiles and parital support for CyberORO/WBaduk, Tygem, Tom, and eWeiqi\n(developers of these backends are currently inactive, everybody is welcome\nto take them over).\n\nGo is an ancient Chinese board game. It's called \"\u570d\u68cb(Wei Qi)\" in\nChinese, \"\u56f2\u7881(Yi Go)\" in Japanese, \"\ubc14\ub451(Baduk)\" in Korean.\n",
