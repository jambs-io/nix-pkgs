Hyper Scrypt is a modern\nstencil typeface inspired by the stained glass technique used in\nthe Metz cathedral. It borrows the stained glass method, drawing\nholes for the light with black lead. This creates a reverse\ntypeface, where the shapes of the letters are drawn by their\ncounters. Hyper Scrypt is at the intersection between 3 metals :\nthe sacred lead of stained glass, the lead of print characters\nand the heavy metal. Despite its organic look inherited for the\nmolted metal, Hyper Scrypt is based upon a rigorous grid,\nallowing some neat alignements between shapes in multi lines\nlayouts.\n",
