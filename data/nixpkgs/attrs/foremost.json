Foremost can work on image files, such\nas those generated by dd, Safeback, Encase, etc, or directly on a drive.\nThe headers and footers can be specified by a configuration file or you can\nuse command line switches to specify built-in file types. These built-in types\nlook at the data structures of a given file format allowing for a more\nreliable and faster recovery.\n",
