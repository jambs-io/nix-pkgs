If you wish to have support for\n      mysql or postgresql dbs, or Jenkins, please contact the maintainer.\n\nBugs which affect this software packaged in Nixpkgs:\n\n1. The package must disable checks, because they are lacking the qt env.\n   (see pkg source and https://discourse.nixos.org/t/qt-plugin-path-unset-in-test-phase/)\n2. There is a segfault on exit. Not a real problem, according to debug log, everything\n   shuts down correctly. Maybe related to https://forums.openlp.org/discussion/3620/crash-on-exit.\n   Plan: Wait for OpenLP-3, since it is already in beta 1\n   (2021-02-09; news: https://openlp.org/blog/).\n",
