While ImageMagick is a versatile tool, it has\na history of several security bugs. A malicious PDF could exploit a bug in\nImageMagick to take over your computer. If you're working with potentially\nmalicious PDFs, it's safest to run them through PDF Redact Tools in an isolated\nenvironment, such as a virtual machine, or by using a tool such as the Qubes\nPDF Converter instead.\n",
