The Argus Project is focused on developing all\n    aspects of large scale network situtational awareness derived from\n    network activity audit. Argus, itself, is next-generation network\n    flow technology, processing packets, either on the wire or in\n    captures, into advanced network flow data. The data, its models,\n    formats, and attributes are designed to support Network\n    Operations, Performance and Security Management. If you need to\n    know what is going on in your network, right now or historically,\n    you will find Argus a useful tool. ",
