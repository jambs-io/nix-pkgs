    "desc_long": "XWinWrap is a small utility written a loooong time ago that allowed you to\nstick most of the apps to your desktop background. What this meant was you\ncould use an animated screensaver (like glmatrix, electric sheep, etc) or\neven a movie, and use it as your wallpaper. But only one version of this\napp was ever released, and it had a few problems, like:\n\n- Well, sticking didn\u2019t work. So if you did a \u201cminimize all\u201d or \u201cgo to\ndesktop\u201d kind of thing, your \u201cwallpaper\u201d got minimized as well.\n\n- The geometry option didn\u2019t work, so you could not create, e.g., a small\nmatrix window surrounded by your original wallpaper.\n\nSeeing no-one picking it up, I decided to give it a bit of polish last\nweekend by fixing the above problems and also add a few features. And here\nit is, in its new avatar \u201cShantz XWinWrap\u201d.\n",
