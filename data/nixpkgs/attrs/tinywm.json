It is only around 50 lines of C. There is\nalso a Python version using python-xlib.\n\nIt lets you do four basic things:\n\n- Move windows interactively with Alt+Button1 drag (left mouse button)\n- Resize windows interactively with Alt+Button3 drag (right mouse button)\n- Raise windows with Alt+F1 (not high on usability I know, but I needed a\n  keybinding in there somewhere)\n- Focus windows with the mouse pointer (X does this on its own)\n",
