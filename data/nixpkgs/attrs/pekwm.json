    "desc_long": "pekwm is a window manager that once upon a time was based on the\naewm++ window manager, but it has evolved enough that it no\nlonger resembles aewm++ at all. It has a much expanded\nfeature-set, including window grouping (similar to ion, pwm, or\nfluxbox), autoproperties, xinerama, keygrabber that supports\nkeychains, and much more.\n- Lightweight and Unobtrusive, a window manager shouldn't be\n  noticed.\n- Very configurable, we all work and think in different ways.\n- Automatic properties, for all the lazy people, make things\n  appear as they should when starting applications.\n- Chainable Keygrabber, usability for everyone.\n",
