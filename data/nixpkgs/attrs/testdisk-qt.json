It was primarily\ndesigned to help recover lost partitions and/or make non-booting disks\nbootable again when these symptoms are caused by faulty software: certain\ntypes of viruses or human error (such as accidentally deleting a\nPartition Table).\n\nPhotoRec is a file data recovery software designed to recover lost files\nincluding video, documents and archives from hard disks, CD-ROMs, and\nlost pictures (thus the Photo Recovery name) from digital camera memory.\nPhotoRec ignores the file system and goes after the underlying data, so\nit will still work even if your media's file system has been severely\ndamaged or reformatted.\n",
