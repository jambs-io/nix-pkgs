Summarizing QRemoteControl\nallows you to do almost everything you would be able to do with a\nmouse and a keyboard, but from a greater distance. To make these\nreplacements possible QRemoteControl offers you a touch pad, a\nkeyboard, multimedia keys and buttons for starting applications. Even\npowering on the computer via Wake On Lan is supported.\n",
