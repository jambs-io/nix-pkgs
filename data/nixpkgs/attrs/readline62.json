Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available.  The\nReadline library includes additional functions to maintain a\nlist of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps\nreedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on\nprevious commands.\n\nThe history facilities are also placed into a separate library,\nthe History library, as part of the build process.  The History\nlibrary may be used without Readline in applications which\ndesire its capabilities.\n",
