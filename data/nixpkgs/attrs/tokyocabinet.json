    "desc_long": "Tokyo Cabinet is a library of routines for managing a database. The\n        database is a simple data file containing records, each is a pair of\n        a key and a value.  Every key and value is serial bytes with\n        variable length.  Both binary data and character string can be used\n        as a key and a value.  There is neither concept of data tables nor\n        data types.  Records are organized in hash table, B+ tree, or\n        fixed-length array.\n\n        Tokyo Cabinet is developed as the successor of GDBM and QDBM on the\n        following purposes.  They are achieved and Tokyo Cabinet replaces\n        conventional DBM products: improves space efficiency, improves time\n        efficiency, improves parallelism, improves usability, improves\n        robustness, supports 64-bit architecture.\n",
