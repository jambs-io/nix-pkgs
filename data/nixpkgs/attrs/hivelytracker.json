    "desc_long": "Hively Tracker is a tracker program based upon the AHX format created in\nthe mid '90s by Dexter and Pink of Abyss. The format was relatively\npopular, and many songs were created and used in scene productions and\ngames. AHX was designed to create a very SID-like sound on the Amiga.\n\nHivelyTracker can import and export modules and instruments in the AHX\nformat, but it also improves on AHX in several ways and therefore has\nits own instrument and module formats.\n",
