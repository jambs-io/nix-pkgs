    "desc_long": "PicoC is a very small C interpreter for scripting. It was originally\nwritten as a script language for a UAV's on-board flight system. It's\nalso very suitable for other robotic, embedded and non-embedded\napplications. The core C source code is around 3500 lines of code. It's\nnot intended to be a complete implementation of ISO C but it has all the\nessentials. When compiled it only takes a few k of code space and is also\nvery sparing of data space. This means it can work well in small embedded\ndevices.\n",
