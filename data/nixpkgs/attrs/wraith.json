It is based on Eggdrop 1.6.12 but has\nsince evolved into something much different at its core. TCL and loadable\nmodules are currently not supported.\n\nMaintainer's Notes:\nCopy the binary out of the store before running it with the -C option to\nconfigure it. See https://github.com/wraith/wraith/wiki/GettingStarted .\n\nThe binary will not run when moved onto non-NixOS systems; use patchelf\nto fix its runtime dependenices.\n",
