Its basic functionality includes a vector\n            and a matrix class, with additional functionality for the\n            often-used 3d and 4d vectors and 3x3 and 4x4 matrices.\n            More advanced functionality include solvers, frustum\n            computations and frustum culling classes, and spatial data structures",
