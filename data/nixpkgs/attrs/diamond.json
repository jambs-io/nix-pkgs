    "desc_long": "A sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA\nsearches and functions as a drop-in replacement for the NCBI BLAST\nsoftware tools. It is suitable for protein-protein search as well as\nDNA-protein search on short reads and longer sequences including contigs\nand assemblies, providing a speedup of BLAST ranging up to x20,000.\n\nDIAMOND is developed by Benjamin Buchfink.
