    "desc_long": "This software allows a standard PC soundcard to be used as a packet radio \"modem\". The whole processing is done on the main processor CPU.\nUnlike previous packet radio modem software, this new release offers several new benefits:\n  - Now uses standard operating system sound drivers (OSS/Free under Linux, /dev/audio under Solaris and DirectSound under Windows), thus runs on all soundcards for which drivers for the desired operating system are available.\n  - No fixed relationship between bitrate, sampling rate, and modem parameters. Modems may be parametrized, and multiple modems may even run on the same audio channel!\n  - Usermode solution allows the use of MMX, VIS, Floating point and other media instruction sets to speed up computation.\n  - Cross platform builds from a single source code provides ubiquitous availability.\n",
