    "desc_long": "ROBODoc is program documentation tool. The idea is to include for every\nfunction or procedure a standard header containing all sorts of\ninformation about the procedure or function. ROBODoc extracts these\nheaders from the source file and puts them in a separate\nautodocs-file. ROBODoc thus allows you to include the program\ndocumentation in the source code and avoid having to maintain two separate\ndocuments. Or as Petteri puts it: \"robodoc is very useful - especially for\nprogrammers who don't like writing documents with Word or some other\nstrange tool.\"\n\nROBODoc can format the headers in a number of different formats: HTML,\nRTF, LaTeX, or XML DocBook. In HTML mode it can generate cross links\nbetween headers. You can even include parts of your source code.\n\nROBODoc works with many programming languages: For instance C, Pascal,\nShell Scripts, Assembler, COBOL, Occam, Postscript, Forth, Tcl/Tk, C++,\nJava -- basically any program in which you can use remarks/comments.\n",
