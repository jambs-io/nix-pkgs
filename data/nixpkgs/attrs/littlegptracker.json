    "desc_long": "LittleGPTracker (a.k.a 'The piggy', 'lgpt') is a music tracker optimised\nto run on portable game consoles. It is currently running on Game Park's\nGP2x & Caanoo, PSP, Dingoo, Windows, Mac OSX (intel/ppc) & Linux (Debian).\n\nIt implements the user interface of littlesounddj, a very famous tracker\nfor the Gameboy platform that has been tried and tested by many users over\nthe years, leading to a little complex but yet extremely efficent way of\nworking.\n\nPiggy currently supports 8 monophonic 16Bit/44.1Khz stereo sample playback\nchannels. Additionally, the program can drive MIDI instruments (with the\ngp32 and gp2x a custom MIDI interface is required).\n",
