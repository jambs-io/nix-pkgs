This simplified style is often preferred for clarity,\nespecially in non-Arabic languages, but may not be considered appropriate\nin situations where a more elaborate style of calligraphy is preferred.\n\nThis package contains the regular and bold styles for the Scheherazade\nfont family, along with documentation.\n",
