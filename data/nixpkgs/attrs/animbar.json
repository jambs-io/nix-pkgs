    "desc_long": "Animbar lets you easily create your own animation on paper and\ntransparancy. From a set of input images two output images are\ncomputed, that are printed one on paper and one on\ntransparency. By moving the transparency over the paper you\ncreate a fascinating animation effect. This kind of animation\ntechnique is hundreds of years old and known under several\nnames: picket fence animation, barrier grid animation, Moir\u00e9\nanimation, to name a few.\n",
