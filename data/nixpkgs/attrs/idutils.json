    "desc_long": "An \"ID database\" is a binary file containing a list of file\nnames, a list of tokens, and a sparse matrix indicating which\ntokens appear in which files.\n\nWith this database and some tools to query it, many\ntext-searching tasks become simpler and faster.  For example,\nyou can list all files that reference a particular `\\#include'\nfile throughout a huge source hierarchy, search for all the\nmemos containing references to a project, or automatically\ninvoke an editor on all files containing references to some\nfunction or variable.  Anyone with a large software project to\nmaintain, or a large set of text files to organize, can benefit\nfrom the ID utilities.\n\nAlthough the name `ID' is short for `identifier', the ID\nutilities handle more than just identifiers; they also treat\nother kinds of tokens, most notably numeric constants, and the\ncontents of certain character strings.\n",
