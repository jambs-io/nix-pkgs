    "desc_long": "The SSH agent is usually spawned by running eval $(ssh-agent), however this\nspawns a new SSH agent at every invocation. This project provides an\nssh-agent wrapper called ssh-agents that is capable of spawning an SSH\nagent and caching the environment variables for later invocation.\n\nFeatures\n- One SSH agent across all terminals\n- Add all un-encrypted SSH keys to the agent upon spawning. Please note\n  that encrypted SSH keys can only be added via ssh-add after having\n  started the agent.\n- Ability to have different keys in different agents for security purposes.\n- Multiple SSH agents\n- To use multi-SSH agents, start ssh agent with the --name flag. The\n  given name is expected to be a folder under ~/.ssh/name containing the\n  keys to include in the agent.\n",
