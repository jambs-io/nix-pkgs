The function knob values are passed to the action scripts as\nwell. Scan actions are also signaled via dbus. This can be useful for\nforeign applications. Scans can also be triggered via dbus from foreign\napplications.\n\nOn platforms which support signaling of dynamic device insertion/removal\n(libudev, dbus, hal), scanbd supports this as well.\n\nscanbd can use all sane-backends or some special backends from the (old)\nscanbuttond project.\n",
