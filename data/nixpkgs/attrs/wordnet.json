Nouns, verbs,\n        adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms\n        (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.  Synsets are\n        interlinked by means of conceptual-semantic and lexical relations.\n        The resulting network of meaningfully related words and concepts can\n        be navigated with the browser.  WordNet is also freely and publicly\n        available for download.  WordNet's structure makes it a useful tool\n        for computational linguistics and natural language processing.\n",
