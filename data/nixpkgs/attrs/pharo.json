By providing a stable and small core\nsystem, excellent dev tools, and maintained releases, Pharo is an\nattractive platform to build and deploy mission critical applications.\n\nThis package provides a front-end for starting the virtual\nmachine. The command 'pharo-vm' automatically detects the type\nof image and executes a suitable virtual machine: CogV3, Spur,\nor Spur64. This makes it easy to open Pharo images because you\ndo not have to worry about which virtual machine variant is\nrequired.\n\nMore about the Cog family of virtual machines:\n  http://www.mirandabanda.org/cogblog/about-cog/\n",
